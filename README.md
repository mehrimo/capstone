# Proposal

For my capstone, I would like to create a Plant Finder App.

### Functionality:

Allows the user to take a photo on their mobile phone and upload it to the webpage. The API will use photo recognition to identify the flower or plant. It will provide details such as: name, is it poisonous?, etc.

### Technologies:

[Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)

AngularJS 1.6

Bootstrap

PostgreSQL

Express

### Unfamiliar Enviroment:

Accessing the phone's hardware for camera access and uploads

Google Vision API

### Stretch Goals:

Use React Native to build a native mobile app

Additional functionality for the user: save the photo to thier photo library, include GPS location, meta data

Deploy on domain "flora-find.com"
